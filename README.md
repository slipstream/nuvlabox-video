# NuvlaBox Video Demonstration

This code captures frames from a video camera, detects faces within
the frames and streams the result.  The demonstration code uses the
Python bindings for the OpenCV framework. 

The code can be deployed from Nuvla to a remote NuvlaBox showing how
physical sensor data can be remotely collected and analyzed.

The code borrows liberally from the three following blog entries:

  * [Getting Webcam Images...](https://codeplasma.com/2012/12/03/getting-webcam-images-with-python-and-opencv-2-for-real-this-time/)
  * [Face Recognition With Python...](https://realpython.com/blog/python/face-recognition-with-python/)
