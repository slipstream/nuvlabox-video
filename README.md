# NuvlaBox Video Demonstration

This code captures frames from a video camera, detects faces within
the frames and streams the result.  The demonstration code uses the
Python bindings for the OpenCV framework. 

The code can be deployed from Nuvla to a remote NuvlaBox showing how
physical sensor data can be remotely collected and analyzed.

The code borrows liberally from the three following blog entries:
