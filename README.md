# NuvlaBox Video Demonstration

This code captures frames from a video camera and detects faces within
the frames.  The code can be deployed from Nuvla to a remote NuvlaBox
showing how physical sensor data can be remotely collected and
analyzed.

The code borrows liberally from the two following blog entries:
